# Enable BBR Congestion Control
# Requires the tcp_bbr module to be loaded, defined in /etc/modules-load.d/bbr.conf
# 
# Note: CAKE is a queue management system that's optimized for latency and throughput.
# It also fixes the hash collision issue that fq_codel has at the cost of a small CPU overhead,
# which is usually negligible on modern hardware because modern CPUs are very fast.
