=============================

Ultramarine Linux is a Linux distribution based on Fedora that aims to provide an simple, no-nonsense
experience for beginners and advanced users alike while being also 100% bug-for-bug compatible with Fedora.

Ultramarine tracks the latest Fedora releases and pulls in the latest updates and standard packages from Fedora.

Ultramarine can also be considered a spiritual successor to the Korora Project,
which was a fork of Fedora that aims to achieve similar goals.
